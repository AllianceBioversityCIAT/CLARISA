                <p>CLARISA (CGIAR Level Agricultural Results Interoperable System Architecture) Is a web service that helps to transform raw data on CGIAR 
                    research and activities into meaningful information that can shape how we work, and reveal what our impacts are on development â€“
                    on reducing poverty, improving food and nutrition security for health, and improving natural resources and ecosystem services.</p>
                <p>In programming terms, CLARISA is a REST-API, which means it is a type of web service that enables computer systems to work together over the Internet. CLARISA enables systems like MARLO, MEL and others to communicate with each other, finds common ground in their data, and produces standardized, aggregated information in the language needed for System-level reports. It works by using control lists of standardized key terms, such as those commonly used by the CGIAR Strategy and Results Framework and the UN Sustainable Development Goals

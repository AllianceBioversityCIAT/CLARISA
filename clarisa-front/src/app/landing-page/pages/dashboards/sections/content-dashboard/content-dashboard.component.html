          CLARISA helps collect and transform the raw CGIAR research and
          activities data into standardized and aggregated information. By
          providing control lists with codes (i.e., unique identifiers), data on
          common indicators can be gathered from the systems adopting these
          codes and the results compiled at a system-wide level, including
          through dashboards.
        </p>
